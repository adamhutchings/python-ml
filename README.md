# python-ml

This is my first attempt at machine learning.

Basically none of this is standard -- I read up a little on how neural networks worked, and then figured out the coding from there.
As such, this is very ad-hoc and probably not conforming to any sort of typical procedure.

Requirements: numpy

Run: `python3 src/testing.py`
